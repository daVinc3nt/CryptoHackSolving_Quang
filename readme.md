# CryptoHackSolving

Welcome to the **CryptoHackSolving** repository!

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Vincent. This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving cryptography challenges, primarily from [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/). Here, you'll find my solutions, notes, and scripts as I explore various cryptographic concepts and techniques.

## Folder Structure
- **general/**: Contains general cryptography challenges and their solutions.
  - **ascii/**: Solutions related to ASCII encoding and manipulation.
    - `exploit.py`: Python script for solving the ASCII challenge.
- **introduction/**: Introductory challenges and learning resources.
  - **pwntools_example/**: Example scripts and notes using the `pwntools` library for interacting with challenges.
    - `exploit.py`: Example exploit script using pwntools.
    - `notes.md`: Notes and explanations for the example.
    - `README.md`: Additional information about this example.

## How to Use
Feel free to browse through the folders and files. Each script is well-commented to help you understand the approach and logic behind the solutions. If you're also learning cryptography, I hope you find these resources helpful!

Happy hacking!
